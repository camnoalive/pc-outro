# pc-outro
You can either use the exe ive provided to run the outro or use python and run the main.py file. This will play a song that lasts 94 seconds while displaying a dancing parrot. I got the dancing parrot from - 
https://parrot.live

If you want to run the outro using python first make sure you have python downloaded onto your desktop. If you dont have python installed you can install it below.
https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing python (not required if running the exe)

download the main.py-file/main.exe file and the audio file. Its also possible to play another audio file by uploading your audio file into the same
directory as the python/exe file. Note that the song wont last longer than 94 seconds. If you want to extend how long until your pc shuts down you can edit this in the python file. 
To run the exe just open the directory its located in and double click or right click and click run.
To run the python file open a terminal in the directory the main.py file is located in and run `python main.py` if that doesnt work somehow run
`python3 main.py`
